1. Uses js class that extents React.Component
2. Props will be received in constructor
3. Render method that will be return a JSX
4. When a component instance is created the constructor will be called just like in case of js  class
5. The Render phase includes: executing of constructor and render method
6. Then comes commit phase in which Component lifecycle methods will be executed and DOM and refs will be updated
7. As updating of DOMs and Refs is expensive process, React will batch the DOM manipulation for the child components
(to optimise performance)

Eg. If a parent component calls a 2 child component then the lifecycle flow will be:

- Parent Constructor
- Parent Render

  - 1st child constructor
  - 1st child render

  - 2nd child constructor
  - 2nd child render

  # DOM Updated in a single batch
  - 1st child component did mount
  - 2nd child component did mount

- Parent component did mount
